== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Wishpond account set up already? =

No, you can create your free account through the plugin, or you can simply use the provided guest account

= Is the 14-day free trial shared with the other Wishpond plugins? =

When you sign up for a free trial with the [Landing Pages Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages-builder/ "Landing Pages Builder") plugin or with our [Social Contests](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wishpond-social-campaigns/ "Run social campaigns on wordpress") plugin, the subscription and trial are shared for the same Wishpond accounts.

When the trial expires you will begin a paid subscription period. If you do not wish to begin a paid subscription period, please cancel your pricing plan within the 14-days of free trial. When you cancel a plan, you can still use our [Facebook Ads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-ads/ "Create Facebook Ads for your wordpress with one button" plugin as before.

The [Facebook Ads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-ads/ "Create Facebook Ads for your wordpress with one button") plugin doesn't require a subscription and therefore doesn't have a trial.

= Can I use the Landing Pages Builder for free? =

Yes, you can try Social Campaigns completely free for the first 14 days.

= How much does it cost to run a landing page? =

* You can run unlimited campaigns for FREE for the first 14 days
* Running landing pages is extremely cost effective. This plugin lets you use features that aren't available on any other plugin.
* You can learn more about our pricing [here](http://corp.wishpond.com/pricing-plans/ "Pricing")

= What kind of support do I get ? =

Wishpond campaigns are extremely easy and fast to set up. If you ever need assistance, we are available to you through live chat, email, and phone support.

= Do I need to set up any wordpress configuration options for this plugin ?=
All you need is to make sure that the Permalinks are set to "Post Name" or "Custom Structure". You would verify this in Settings->Permalinks.

= Where are Landing Pages stored ? =
Your Landing Pages are stored on Wishpond, so that you can add email automation, ad campaigns and other features to your Landing Pages.

= How do I delete a Landing Page ? =
After you create a Landing Page, you can view it under "Landing Pages". Click the "Manage" link under the landing page to get to the management screen for that specific landing page. To delete it, simply scroll to the bottom of the management screen to delete that landing page.

= What URL should I use when creating a Landing Page ? =
When creating a landing page you have to make sure you use the domain of the wordpress page you are on, followed by the path at which you want the landing page to be hosted. So if my wordpress site is at "http://www.wishpond.com" (and I can see this in the address bar) and I want to host my Landing Page at "new-landing-page", then I would use the following url "http://www.wishpond.com/new-landing-page".

= What if my wordpress site is on a multisite installation ? =
If your wordpress site is hosted under a multi-site installation, then your wordpress path would be preceeded by your site's domain. For example, if your wordpress site is hosted at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/" then you can host a landing page at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/landing-page"

= I can't publish a landing page, what's wrong ? =
When editing a Landing Page you must make sure the URL you specify begins with the same domain name and protocol(http or https) as your wordpress site. In other words, if your wordpress site is hosted at "https://my-wordpress-site.com" you can't use "http://my-wordpress-site.com" or "https://www.my-wordpress-site.com" or any other variation.

= What are guest users ? =
If you want to try out the plugin, simply go in Landing Pages->Settings and click on the checkbox right next to "Guest User", then click "Save Changes". This will automatically create a wishpond account for you, with a guest e-mail address, that you can change later.

= I have another question, what do I do? =

Contact us anytime! If you ever need a question, you can always call us at: 1-800-921-0167, email us at [support@wishpond.com](mailto://support@wishpond.com "Wishpond Support") or just use the live chat available to you directly through this plugin.
